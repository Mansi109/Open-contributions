### Hi, I am Mansi Kaushik
##### I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science field and I am interested in Machine Learning.
##### I have intermediate knowledge of Python and Machine Learning and I am also familiar with the basics of Computer Vision.
##### Python:

- Datatypes
  1. Strings
  2. Tuples
  3. Lists 
  4. Dictionaries
  5. Numbers 
      - Integers
      - Float
      - Decimal
      - Boolean
- Python Operators
- Flow Control
- Loops
- Regular Expressions
- Functions

##### Machine Learning-
 
I am familiar with the following topics:
- Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Bias-Variance
- Evalutation Metrics (precision, recall, F1)

##### OpenCV:

- No prior knowledge, a complete fresher.
- OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
- OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.
- Since OpenCV is one among the important fields in Python, I'd like to gain more knowledge about it.
